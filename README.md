# Requirements

Requires a font [patched with md icons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), it's not served in the css. Any latency on a new tab page is frustrating, you don't want the page to hang on a 300kb ttf request. Ubuntu is provided in the /fonts directory. My screenshot is using a proprietary font but a similar one is [Inter from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).

# Install

Just fork, change the links and icons to whatever you want and deploy. Grab icons from the [NF cheatsheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).

# Deploy

You can use github pages, it's free, fast and config-free.

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Click on repository settings.
3. Under 'Deploy from a branch', select your master/main branch and save.
